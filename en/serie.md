# The Last of Us: the TV serie

![Road](../assets/road.jpg)

## Summary
The series currently consists of a single season of nine episodes, adapting the first video game from 2013. A second season is in production and will adapt the second installment across seasons 2 and 3. This first season remains fairly faithful to the game. We also follow Joel Miller, a smuggler, who must escort Ellie across the United States.

## Differences
However, some differences exist compared to the original version, sometimes due to the creators’ desire to expand the universe, and sometimes for visual simplicity.

- Episode 3: Episode 3 is perhaps the most significant difference, condensed into a single episode. The romance is only implied in the video game; Frank is no longer present and leaves a letter for Bill. The creators, particularly Neil Druckmann, who is also the creator of the video game, took advantage of the format to make a relationship explicit that was only implied in the game, adding more depth to an already expansive universe. This episode was the most surprising and the one that moved me the most due to its unexpectedness.

- The Infected: In the video game The Last of Us, infected individuals are classified into categories; they are infected by fungi, and the older they are, the more powerful and prominent they become. They spread infection through spores, airborne particles that infect anyone who breathes them in. In the series, this classification has been maintained, but the spore system has been replaced by tendrils on the ground connecting the infected to one another. This change avoids a visual complication, as spores are difficult to depict on screen. However, spores play an important role in certain scenes of the second installment, which have not yet been adapted for the series.

 - Additional Information: Similarly to the explicit adaptation in Episode 3, additional background information has been provided about characters such as Joel Miller and Ellie Williams’ mother — a mysterious character who is nearly absent in the video game. Scientific information is also added, often as an introduction to certain episodes. For example, in the first episode, a scientist discusses the virus and the danger it would pose if it existed. This introduction helps create tension for the viewer.
