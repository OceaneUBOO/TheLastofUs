## The Last of Us

### The_The Last of Us_franchise 

*The Last of Us* is a video game franchise composed of two installments: *The Last of Us* released in 2013, and its direct sequel, *The Last of Us Part II* released in 2020.

Both games were widely acclaimed, which explains the release of a second installment. This universe has recently gained even more popularity thanks to its television adaptation, which aired in 2023 on HBO.

#### General Summary
The world of The Last of Us is set in a post-apocalyptic environment following the outbreak of a virus called cordyceps. This cordyceps is a fungus that infects humans, who then transform and become “infected” (and not zombies, which are undead beings).
Set within this violent universe, the protagonists must struggle to survive and to regain faith in humanity by searching for a cure. The themes explored are far from being centered solely on the infected and the post-apocalyptic setting; instead, they focus primarily on human relationships and on the love between a young girl and her paternal figure, which makes this work deeply moving and profoundly human.
