# The Last of Us: The Video Games

The original format of this universe is the video game. The world was created and developed by Neil Druckmann and the studio **Naughty Dog** in order to be experienced and told through an immersive game.

## _The Last of Us_ (2013)
The first installment of the franchise follows Joel Miller, a man who lost everything at the outbreak of the apocalypse and who has since become a smuggler in order to survive. He is tasked with crossing the United States to deliver his cargo — a very particular cargo, which turns out to be a mysterious young girl, Ellie Williams.
Together, they travel across the country and overcome the trials that stand in their way, gradually growing closer and forming an almost familial bond.

>This first installment is centered on love and human relationships, particularly between the two protagonists.

## _The Last of Us Part II_ (2020)
Without revealing too much, this second installment is the direct sequel to the first and this time follows an adult Ellie Williams, who was the deuteragonist of the first game. She must face a new enemy and travels across the country in order to find them.

Some people believe that this second installment is centered on the cycle of revenge, but I personally consider it to focus on regret and on the acceptance of those regrets.
